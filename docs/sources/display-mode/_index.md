# Display mode

The Business Variable panel enhances dashboard variables by making them more user-friendly and allowing to place the panel anywhere on the dashboard.

The Business Variable panel configuration starts with the **Display mode** parameter. With that, you determine the style and, consequently, other available parameters for configuration.

As of now, there are four available options for the **Display Mode** parameter.
