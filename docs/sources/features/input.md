# Input text box

The Business Variable panel supports input text boxes in the **Table** and **Minimize** display modes.

In the **Table** display mode, you can use the **Sticky position** option to keep the Business Variable panel in sight when scrolling the dashboard.

## Enter the key for the text box type

Pressing the Enter key after typing a text value in the Text box variable type triggers a dashboard refresh.

Before this feature was implemented, users had to click outside the box for the variable to take effect.
